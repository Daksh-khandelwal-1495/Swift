## Project Description
As urban areas grow, cities face increasing challenges in managing traffic congestion, optimizing delivery routes, and ensuring sustainable transportation. **Urban Mobility and Route Optimization** is a data-driven solution designed to address these challenges by integrating **delivery route optimization** with **city traffic analysis**. Our goal is to make urban logistics more efficient, reduce environmental impact, and improve the quality of life for citizens.

This project was developed as part of the **Deloitte Hackplosion** competition, where we aimed to create a solution that not only solves the problem but also aligns with Deloitte's vision of **innovation and sustainability**.

## Why We Are Making This
Urbanization is accelerating, and with it comes the challenges of traffic congestion, inefficient logistics, and environmental degradation. Traditional methods of route planning and traffic management are no longer sufficient. Our solution leverages **real-time data**, **machine learning**, and **advanced analytics** to:

1. **Optimize Delivery Routes**: Reduce delivery times, fuel consumption, and operational costs for businesses.
2. **Improve Urban Mobility**: Provide actionable insights for city planners to manage traffic flow and enhance public transport efficiency.
3. **Enhance Safety**: Identify accident-prone areas and provide safer routes for drivers and citizens.
4. **Promote Sustainability**: Integrate Air Quality Index (AQI) data to encourage eco-friendly routing and reduce carbon emissions.

By addressing these issues, we aim to create a **smarter, greener, and safer urban future**.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Route Optimization**: Dynamically adjust delivery routes based on traffic, weather, and AQI data.
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Identify congestion hotspots and predict future traffic conditions using AI.
- **Public Transport Optimization**: Analyze public transport usage to improve efficiency and reduce wait times.
- **Safety Insights**: Analyze accident data to identify high-risk areas and suggest safer routes.
